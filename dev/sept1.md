12. for message part : make button say 'Send Message' and separate it more,
		further down. and please wait screen after the submition

13. Part 2 : instead of waiting on the part 2 have screen say "please wait" and then
go to the part 2 screen

14. Part 3 : Have the game in a square shape cover more of the screen. New
		format for page. Intructions are a tooltip. The things on the side are
		clearer and the locator text is above the game. The locator has a
		thicker line and a draw circle. Close is 0-20, Far is 21-100

15. Line breaks should be respected. button further down. wait screen. no
		wait for other person, should just go directly to pay off.

16. Just leave it blank on show earnings instead of lines. narrower table
		and same width for two last columns. go straight to part 4, no waiting
		for people to see their earnings.
