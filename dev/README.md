#Old Plan
##'Quick' Fixes ( 0 / 3 )
5. slider : working on it.
47. try refresh
56. cannot reproduce. try in the lab.
##Changes ( 0 / 5 )
19. use the python to see if i need to change how the questions are
	formatted and certain messages
44. timestamps
52. need to think how to do this. have two variables for each ngshow.
58. figure out how to change pages without barriers
63. create recv for admin for messages sent. organize messages. ask
	curtis/logan if there is an experiment that gets updated in real
	time.

#Old Feedback
5. The tick labels of part 3 are all collapsed in one point
19. Parse the output
44. take timestamps for each page
47. try to have the income stay the same when refresh page; create flot
	at the beginning
52. no barrier for taking money. just use trigger/send
56. on show earnings it shows null if the value was 0
58. between each pair, there should be the smallest wait possible (no
	barriers)
63. see data in real time on the admin page (easier to make a csv)

#Plan
##Quick Fixes ( 0 / 0 )
69. for treatment, change 'normal' to 'directed message'
##Changes ( 0 / 4 )
64. prepare system
65. enter system
66. enter system
67. enter system
68. remove part 1 and part 4, create new page

#New Feedback
64. prepare for elicitation methods
65. add BDM2 elicitation method
66. add SOP elicitation method
67. add BDM-WTA elicitation method
68. create six sliders for the part 1 and part 4. for the emotions :
	'angry', 'happy', 'sad', 'discust', 'fear', 'suprize' (Inside Out
	Emotions)
	vertical sliders. the number on the button. or below the slider
	make the order of the emotions random
69. for treatments, instead of 'normal' name it 'directed message'

#for the future
instructions before the part 1
sometype of hardware that takes data from person's body
different ways on how to choose the willingness
