fix debug
when two readers, split the messages

the click on the game should be one line, so it doesn't jump
the flot yellow a tiny bit darker

no barrier for taking money. just use trigger/send

screens shouldnt sleep during experiments

maxwillingness to pay is 0-3 dollars

if person lost willingness to pay, it should pop up if they didnt win : 
	'you willingness was ___, actual price was ___. you lost'

change order to wtp -> message -> show price before it was wtp ->
showprice -> message

on show earnings it shows null if the value was 0

for reader messages it should show up as :
	(money taken : {{moneytaken}})
	{{message}}
